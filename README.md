# Plugin for connecting MetaEditor with Pixel Streaming (Unreal Engine)

If you're a developer working with Unreal Engine, you may be interested in using a plugin that helps your web client interact with your Unreal Engine project. This plugin enables seamless communication between the web client and your project.
